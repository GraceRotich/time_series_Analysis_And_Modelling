    "\n",
    "The real estate market presents a dynamic and complex investment landscape, where the value of investments can significantly impact the financial well-being of investors. Identifying lucrative investment opportunities requires analyzing vast amounts of historical data to predict future trends, with the inherent volatility and regional diversity of the real estate market. Investors seek to maximize returns while managing the risks associated with market fluctuations and regional economic changes.The primary stakeholder in this project is Prime Nest Investment real-estate company which is  focused on identifying  the top 5 zip codes for real estate investment and optimizing their portflolios permomance by selecting regions with the highest potential for growth and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Problem Statement:*\n",
    "\n",
    "The core challenge faced by PrimeNest Investments is the difficulty in accurately forecasting real estate prices across various zip codes, taking into account factors like profit margins, risk and investment horizons. The firm needs to navigate through the ambiguity and complexity of the real estate market to identify zip codes that promise the best returns on investment, balanced with an acceptable level of risk.\n",
    "By leveraging historical real estate price data from Zillow Research and employing time series modeling, PrimeNest Investments seeks a comprehensive analysis and recommendation to facilitate informed decision-making and strategic expansion of their investment portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Challenges:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Historical Data Only*: The dataset does not include future or real-time data, limiting the analysis to historical trends and necessitating assumptions about future market behavior.\n",
    "- *Lack of External Factors*: External economic indicators such as interest rates, employment rates and GDP growth which can significantly influence real estate prices are not included. This absence might limit the comprehensiveness of the forecast.\n",
    "- *Missing Values*: Any missing data could affect the analysis's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Objectives*\n",
    "\n",
    "- To provide a data-driven basis for investment decisions with a model having accuracy of 80%.\n",
    "- To identify zip codes with the highest potential for appreciation, thereby maximizing ROI.\n",
    "- To offer insights into market trends, enabling stakeholders to manage risks better and align investments with long-term financial goals.\n",
